  ""\
  "The hostages are only useful to use if our bomb is still active as we can use them to delay the enemy. If it's defused, we'll have no use for the them and we can do as we see fit."\
  "(Hostages have been instructed to compley with OPFOR orders for the most part, but ultimately it's down to them if they wish to attemp a break out or disobey orders, at which point their punishment is open to OPFORs creativity)"\

  "LORE: Radical environmentalist from the Earth Contamination Outfit have launched a surprise attack on a TEM POWER oil rig off the coast of Scotland."\
  "British intelligence has been monitoring us for some years now as we've become more prominent within the UK, but clearly this has slipped under their radar, including the movement of our weapons and equipment for the operation. Our outfit has conducted other operations before around the UK, but not on this scale."\
  "Arriving by boat, we proceeded up the stairs and took over the rig by force. A good portion of the crew managed to escape by the life rafts, but a handful were rounded up."\
  "We've managed to capture 5 workers. Lets use them to hold off the assault we'll be expecting."\
