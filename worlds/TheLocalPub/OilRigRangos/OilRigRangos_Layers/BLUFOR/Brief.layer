  "LORE: Radical environmentalist from the Earth Contamination Outfit have launched a surprise attack on a TEM POWER oil rig off the coast of Scotland."\
  "British intelligence has been monitoring the group for some years now as they've become more prominent within the UK, but clearly this has slipped under their radar, including the movement of weapons and equipment for the group to carry out this attack. The outfit has conducted other operations before around the UK, but not on this scale."\
  "Arriving by boat, the group proceeded up the stairs and took over the rig by force. A good portion of the crew managed to escape by the life rafts, but a handful were captured."\
  "An estimated number of 5 crew members are still unaccounted for."\
  "We must save them and secure the rig!"\
