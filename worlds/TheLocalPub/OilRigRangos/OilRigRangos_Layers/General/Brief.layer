  "• Once the bomb is defused, ECO team WILL deem hostages non-valuable anymore and have free rein to do as they please with said hostages, whatever that entails."\

  "|PERFORMANCE|"\
  "The performance on this rig compared to Arma 3 is much higher, yet you may fine that during the night, lighting will cause a lower FPS due to lamps/lights having to cast mutiple smaller shadows around and through props. This is also worse if it's also raining heavy."\
  "This is most noticeable in the center where the big flood lights cast the shadows from the big tower, gangwalks, and chain lined fences."\
  "Try turning your shadows or lighting quality down to increase FPS."\
  "(In my testing at full graphics, I had 45+ FPS in the center at night)"\
  "- If it's unplayable, a GM can change the weather and/or time to be something similar but not as bad, have some discretion."

  m_sTitle "Changelog"
  m_sTextData "V2 | 12/10/25"\
  "•  Added:"\
  "- Steerable parachutes to Blufor."\
  "- 2x extra RHIB boats to each dock like as orignally planned and gave them all an extra 1x box of 50cal ammo. "\
  "This should allow for the boats to better split up making for less rich targets and also allow some boats to have a skeleton crew used just to suppress while still enough boats to actually assault."\
  "- 2nd armed huey helicopter and abit of extra ammo for the guns."\
  "- Additional gangwalks on the oil rig to better allowed covered movement from one half to the other."\
  "- Additional prop placement around the rig for further detailing but to also provide cover in certain places to better aid gameplay, such as a large container on the construction site roof, to cover dismounting troops from helicopters."\
  "- Photos of the rig for the ECO team."\
  ""\
  "• Fixed:"\
  "- An oversight in the end conditions that meant one disabled another and created a snow ball affect of flags/variable not then being able to be set."\
  "The end conditions should fully function now and the rig should be capable of detonating manually. "\
  ""\
  "• Changed: "\
  "- Blufor loadouts have been updated to accurate gear and also adjusted to give more equipment and ammo."\
  "- Upped the collision damage the helipad can take, so it doesn't get destroyed when landing hard."
